# PopularMovies

Application developed for "Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree"

## Project Summary

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
You’ll build the complete functionality of this app in two stages which you will submit separately.
<br/>Stage 1:  Main Discovery Screen, A Details View, and Settings
<br/>Stage 2:  Trailers, Reviews, and Favorites

## User Experience


In Stage1 the core experience of movies app will be build.
<br/>App will:
* Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting: The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
    * Original title movie poster image thumbnail
    * A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
    * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
    * release date
    
<br/><br/>In Stage 2 additional functionality will be added to the app you built in Stage 1.
* Add more information to movie details view:
    * Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
    * Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
    * Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
    * Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
* Optimize your app experience for tablet.
